    """Extract keypoints from a query image using pre-built feature extractors.

    Runs each extractor on ``query_image``, concatenates the detected keypoints,
    and returns exactly ``max_query_num`` points when ``strict_num`` is True by
    either randomly subsampling or padding with random points.

    Args:
        query_image: Input image tensor of shape (1, C, H, W).
        extractors: Iterable of lightglue-style extractors. Each must expose
            ``extract(image)["keypoints"]`` returning a tensor of shape
            (1, N, 2).
        max_query_num: Target number of keypoints to return.
        strict_num: If True, pad with random points when fewer than
            ``max_query_num`` keypoints are detected.

    Returns:
        Tensor of shape (1, N, 2) containing (x, y) keypoint coordinates, where
        N equals ``max_query_num`` when ``strict_num`` is True.
