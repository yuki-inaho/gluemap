"""Unit tests for the pygluemap track-pruning bindings.

These cover ``compute_tracks_to_delete`` and
``compute_virtual_tracks_to_delete``
in [gluemap/pybind/track_selection.cc](gluemap/pybind/track_selection.cc), which
classify tracks as SIFT vs non-SIFT and prune non-SIFT tracks whose image-pair
coverage is already above a threshold. SIFT-vs-non-SIFT classification is
implicit: an observation is SIFT iff its ``pt2d_idx`` is below
``sift_count[image_id]``.

The pair-count dictionary uses a packed canonical key ``(min<<32) | max`` over
the two image IDs.
