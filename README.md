## About

GLUEMAP is the first Structure-from-Motion pipeline to integrate
feed-forward reconstruction backbones into a global SfM framework.
It takes a collection of images as input and outputs a COLMAP sparse reconstruction. 
It matches the scalability and accuracy of traditional SfM pipelines while inheriting the local robustness of a feed-forward backbone.
It pairs their resilience on hard local geometry (low overlap, repetitive structures, weak texture) with the accuracy, global consistency, and large-scene tractability that classical SfM provides.

The pipeline comprises:

1. **Retrieval** — SALAD global descriptors build the image neighbor graph.
2. **Two-view inference (optional)** — Doppelgangers++ (MAST3R-based) estimates covisibility of pairs. Can be skipped via `skip_doppelgangers` when the scene has no repetitive structure or when a quick result is preferred (see [Configuration](#configuration)).
3. **Multi-view inference** — a configurable backbone (Pi3 / Pi3X / VGGT / MapAnything) estimates poses and geometry in local star configurations.
4. **Global mapping** — rotation averaging, intrinsics averaging,
   similarity averaging, and global bundle adjustment fuse the local solutions.
5. **Refinement** — COLMAP local features (default ALIKED + LightGlue with sequential matching), track snapping, and iterative augmented bundle adjustment.

The orchestrator is [gluemap/controllers/gluemap_impl.py](gluemap/controllers/gluemap_impl.py).

## Getting Started

GLUEMAP is a Python package with a C++/pybind11 extension (`pygluemap`)
that links against Ceres, Eigen, Boost, and OpenMP, plus several
feed-forward models vendored as git submodules.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/colmap/gluemap.git
cd gluemap
git submodule update --init --recursive

# In a Python ≥ 3.10 environment with Ceres / Eigen / METIS / Boost / OpenMP available:
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX pip install -e .
```

For the reproducible conda/micromamba recipe (pinned versions, CUDA
notes, libstdc++ ABI troubleshooting), see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

The default config expects four model checkpoints under `checkpoints/`
(Pi3, SALAD, VGGSfM tracker, Doppelgangers++). Download commands are in
[INSTALL.md §4](INSTALL.md#4-download-model-checkpoints).

Verify the install:

```bash
python -c "import gluemap; import pygluemap; print(pygluemap.__file__)"
gluemap-demo --help
```

## Usage

### Single image collection

```bash
gluemap-demo \
    --config configs/example.yaml \
    --images_path /path/to/images \
    --intrinsics_mode SHARED \
    --write_path results/
```

The reconstruction is written under `--write_path` in COLMAP format.

### Multi-sequence

When `--images_path` holds several video sequences of the same scene as
sibling subfolders (e.g. LAMAR's `ios*` sequences), enable multi-sequence
mode and supply a regex that selects the subfolders to process:

```bash
gluemap-demo \
    --config configs/example.yaml \
    --images_path /path/to/scene \
    --subfolder_regex '^ios' \
    --is_multi_sequence \
    --intrinsics_mode PER_CAMERA \
    --write_path results/
```

This auto-enables sequential pairing within each subfolder.

### Multi-GPU

Two-view and star-inference stages parallelize across ranks via
`init_distributed()` in [gluemap/utils/gpu.py](gluemap/utils/gpu.py).
Global mapping and refinement run on rank 0 only. Launch with
`torchrun --nproc_per_node=N gluemap-demo ...` (or set `RANK` /
`WORLD_SIZE` manually).

### Benchmarks

`gluemap-benchmark` runs a config-driven sweep over multiple datasets
(see [configs/lamar.yaml](configs/lamar.yaml) for the LAMAR layout).

## Configuration

Configs live in [configs/](configs/) and inherit shared defaults from
[configs/base.yaml](configs/base.yaml) via `_base_:`. CLI flags override
config values, so anything in `base.yaml` can be tweaked without editing
the file.

The most-touched knobs:

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `images_path` / `write_path` | Input directory / output directory. |
| `chosen_model` | Multi-view backbone: `pi3` (default), `pi3x`, `vggt`, `map_anything`. |
| `path_feedforward` | Checkpoint for the chosen multi-view model. |
| `path_retrieval` / `path_tracker` / `path_dg` | SALAD / VGGSfM / Doppelgangers++ checkpoints. |
| `camera_model` | COLMAP camera model (default `SIMPLE_PINHOLE`). |
| `intrinsics_mode` | Intrinsics-bucketing strategy: `SHARED` (one camera per unique image shape, default), `PER_FOLDER` (one camera per `(dirname, shape)` pair), or `PER_CAMERA` (one camera per image). |
| `feature_extractor` / `feature_matcher` | COLMAP local feature stack for refinement tracks. Defaults to `ALIKED_N16ROT` + `ALIKED_LIGHTGLUE` on COLMAP 4.x. |
| `feature_pairing` / `feature_sequential_overlap` | Local feature pairing strategy. Defaults to COLMAP sequential matching; `feature_sequential_overlap: null` reuses `num_neighbors_sequential`. |
| `feature_backend` | `auto` selects the safest backend. ALIKED uses the external `colmap` CLI when pycolmap wheels expose ALIKED enums but lack ONNX runtime support. |
| `num_neighbors` | Neighbors per image in the retrieval graph (default `100`). |
| `is_sequential` / `sample_frequency` | Use temporal pairing for ordered video; subsample every Nth frame. |
| `is_multi_sequence` / `subfolder_regex` | Process several sibling sequences into a single reconstruction. |
| `rerun_from` | Resume from `retrieval`, `twoview`, or `star` to skip earlier stages. |
| `coarse_only` | Stop after global mapping; skip the refinement stage. |
| `skip_doppelgangers` | Skip the Doppelgangers++ two-view disambiguator and treat all retrieval pairs as valid. Useful when the scene has no repetitive structure or for a quick first result. Default `false`. |

See [configs/base.yaml](configs/base.yaml) for the complete surface and
default values.

<summary><b>Choosing a backbone</b></summary>

`chosen_model` selects the multi-view star-inference model. Each
backbone needs its own `path_feedforward` checkpoint:

- **`pi3`** — Pi3, default; `checkpoints/pi3.safetensors`.
- **`pi3x`** — Pi3X variant; same Pi3 checkpoint family.
- **`vggt`** — Facebook VGGT-1B; download `model.pt` from
  HuggingFace `facebook/VGGT-1B`.
- **`map_anything`** — Facebook MapAnything; set
  `path_feedforward: facebook/map-anything` (HF repo id, not a file path).

Dispatch lives in [gluemap/utils/model_loader.py](gluemap/utils/model_loader.py).

<details>
<summary><b>Adding a custom backbone</b></summary>

To plug in a different multi-view model, add a wrapper under
[gluemap/ff_inference/](gluemap/ff_inference/) that inherits the
`LocalInference` abstract base class from
[gluemap/ff_inference/local_inference.py](gluemap/ff_inference/local_inference.py)
and implements `predict(batch: dict) -> dict`.

The contract:

- **Input** `batch["images"]` of shape `(B, N, 3, H, W)`. Subclasses may
  read additional keys.
- **Output** dict with at minimum `depth`, `depth_conf`, `extrinsics`,
  `intrinsics`.

Use the existing wrappers as references:

- [gluemap/ff_inference/pi3_inference.py](gluemap/ff_inference/pi3_inference.py)
- [gluemap/ff_inference/vggt_inference.py](gluemap/ff_inference/vggt_inference.py)
- [gluemap/ff_inference/mapanything_inference.py](gluemap/ff_inference/mapanything_inference.py)

Then register the new wrapper in `create_local_inference()` in
[local_inference.py](gluemap/ff_inference/local_inference.py) so it
dispatches on the `chosen_model` string set in your config.

> **Note:** the input image size and patch size are fixed in
> [gluemap/datasets/star.py](gluemap/datasets/star.py) (`image_size=518`,
> `patch_size=14`), matching the Pi3/DINOv2-style encoders used by the
> default backbones. If your custom backbone uses a different encoder
> (e.g. DINOv3, which uses a patch size of 16), update `self.patch_size`
> (and `self.image_size` if needed) accordingly so the preprocessed
> images align with the encoder's patch grid.
